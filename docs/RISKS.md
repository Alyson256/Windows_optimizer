# Risks & Details

Transparent breakdown of what each script does, which registry keys it touches, and what the risks are.

---

## 02 — Services → Manual

**Risk: 🟢 Low**

Sets `start=demand` (Manual), NOT `start=disabled`.  
The service will still launch if Windows or another application requests it.

| Service | Default | Changed to | Impact if stopped |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| SysMain | Automatic | Manual | No disk pre-caching. Negligible on SSDs. |
| WSearch | Automatic | Manual | Search indexing paused. File search still works. |
| DiagTrack | Automatic | Manual | Telemetry stops uploading. |
| XblAuthManager | Automatic | Manual | Xbox Live login may prompt on first use. |
| RemoteRegistry | Automatic | Manual | Remote registry editing disabled. |

## 03 — Disable Windows Recall

**Risk: 🟢 Low**

Writes `DisableAIDataAnalysis = 1` to Group Policy keys:
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`
- `HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`

These are **policy keys** — they override user settings but can be removed cleanly.
Only affects Windows 11 24H2+ builds (≥ 26100).

---

## 04 — Disable Telemetry

**Risk: 🟢 Low**

- Sets `AllowTelemetry = 0` in two policy paths.
- On Windows 11 **Home**, Microsoft may enforce a minimum of level 1 (Basic) despite the key being set to 0. This is by design. The key is still written.
- Does NOT modify the `hosts` file (no risk of blocking Windows Update CDN).

### Optional: Hosts file blocking
If you want to block telemetry endpoints at the network level, you can manually add entries to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. This is not done automatically because it can occasionally block legitimate Microsoft services (e.g., update CDNs that share IPs).

## 05 — Power Plan

**Risk: 🟢 Low**

- High Performance plan draws more power — relevant only for laptops on battery.
- Disabling hibernation removes `hiberfil.sys` (~size of RAM). This is irreversible from this script; re-run `10_undo_all.bat` or run `powercfg /h on` manually.
- Disabling Fast Startup means slightly slower shutdown. This is intentional — Fast Startup is a hybrid-sleep that can cause driver state issues on wake.

## 06 — Visual Tweaks

**Risk: 🟢 Low / 🟢 None**

All changes are in `HKCU` (current user only). ClearType is explicitly preserved.  
Explorer is restarted automatically — taskbar will flicker briefly.

---

## 07 — Network Tweaks

**Risk: 🟡 Medium**

- **Nagle Algorithm off**: Can slightly increase upload bandwidth usage (more small packets). Beneficial for gaming, video calls, and SSH. No downside for most broadband connections.
- **ECN disabled**: Rare routers don't support ECN and may drop connections. Disabling it avoids this edge case.
- **NetworkThrottlingIndex**: Setting to `0xFFFFFFFF` removes Windows' background throttling on multimedia streams. Beneficial for gaming and DAW software.

---

## 08 — Privacy Tweaks

**Risk: 🟢 None**

All keys are either `HKCU` (user-level) or policy keys that Windows reads but doesn't depend on for stability.  
Camera/microphone access is **not** changed — those remain user-controllable in Settings > Privacy.

---

## 09 — Startup Audit

**Risk: None (read-only)**

Outputs a list of startup registry entries and scheduled tasks. No changes made.

---

## 10 — Undo All

**Risk: 🟢 None**

Restores defaults by **deleting policy keys** (the cleanest approach — avoids writing wrong values).  
Services are set back to `start=auto` or `start=demand` according to Windows 11 defaults. Visual effects return to "Let Windows decide".

---

## 11 — Remove Bloatware

**Risk: 🟢 Low**

Removes pre-installed UWP apps via PowerShell. Doesn't touch core OS components. The script pauses to ask if Xbox Game Bar (which has native screen recording) should be removed. All apps can be reinstalled freely through the Microsoft Store.

---

## 12 — System Cleanup

**Risk: None**

Empties official Windows temporary folders (`%TEMP%`, `C:\Windows\Temp`), flushes the network adapter's DNS resolver cache, deletes the Windows clean update download cache, and empties the recycle bin globally. Essentially equals using a standard Windows cleaner with zero risk to user data or system files.
